           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>My name is Joseph Imondi. I am a transfer student from Johnson & Wales. I initially left Johnson and Wales in 2019 to join the Air Force. Now that my 
                training is over I am finally back in school at the University of Rhode Island. Some of my hobbies consist of working on cars, building computers, 
                and playing video games. I have a love for sports as well, my favorite being hockey since I am a goalie myself. I am very excited to start up school 
                again and cant wait to learn more about coding!</p>
